            <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
            <p><br>Hi!  My name is Ian Carlo Bayantong Quimbo. I am the one responsible for this website. I hope you will like this website.
                I live in Kihare, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon.<br> A home to basketball enthusiasts. Growing up, I did idolize Michael Jordan
                for his greatness in basketball. I really did like
                to play basketball. For me, life was stress free once you start playing basketball. I also made friends just by
                playing basketball. 
                Singing is also one of my hobbies. I grow up in church, trained and a member of a choir. <br>I can also say that I have a pretty decent voice.
                I love to sing, especially for the Lord. I love the way I sing, how can I make people smile from my voice, and many more.
            </p>

                8 years from now, I will be more hands on in attending our church's choir, be more productive to the church
                    and be more effective. If God willing, 8 years from now, I will complete my college degree and have a successful life.
